The reason protocol-server.go#L70 [2] not working, is that \"req.outHeader().Length\" is not actually used and overwritten later in request.serializeHeader() [3].\n\nI also tested that, after removing the hack code at [2] and apply this MR, it continues to work on kernel 3.10.  I think we should do so.  Any suggestions?\n\n[1] https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/pull/575/commits/fdce6923194c06e3ac00abc80ce7f96c1694caa0\n[2] https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/blob/master/fuse/protocol-server.go#L7\n[3] https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/blob/master/fuse/request.go#L279",
