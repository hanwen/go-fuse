      "message": "I like that this change was motivated by numbers, but for me to accept a change, I have to be able to replicate these numbers, and the replication should be self-contained. Can you make a benchmark (eg. under benchmark/ ) that shows the problem? Information about x86 vs ARM is useful. I normally develop on x86, but I can spin up ARM64 if necessary.",

      "message": "it makes the logic simple, but if your file system is network backed, requests can take arbitarily long to finish. So if you have a multithreaded load on the FS with MaxLoopNum parallel requests, and there is a network hiccup, then nothing is serving the FUSE device, and all further access to the filesystem will hang.
