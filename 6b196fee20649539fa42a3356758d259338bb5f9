      "message": "Not sure about this.\n\nGo stdlib, x/sys/unix and glibc all search for a null byte, but they search from the beginning, not the end.\n\nSearching from the end fails if there are multiple null bytes interspersed with non-null bytes.\n\nCan this happen? I don\u0027t know. But it seems like something is strange here, because if you can rely on reclen, then you don\u0027t need any of this. I guess the kernel may add padding after the name? Then, is guaranteed that only null bytes are used as padding?",
