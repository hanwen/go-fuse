      "message": "The check for EUID\u003d0 is actually not needed. /dev/fuse is usually readable-writable for _all_ users and it is sys.Mount that is usually failing with EPERM for non-root. However since we anyway fallback on using /bin/fusermount if any of open(/dev/fuse) or sys_mount fails, imho it is better to drop the `if EUID\u003d\u003d0` check and just see what kernel gives us.",
